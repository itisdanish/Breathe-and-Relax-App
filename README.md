# Breathe-and-Relax-App
A Simple "Breathe and Relax" app that uses JavaScript and a responsive user interface
This app displays a "Start" button, and when the user clicks it, the button disappears, a countdown timer appears, and the app displays instructions to breathe in and out. The breatheIn() and breatheOut() functions are called using setTimeout() to alternate the instructions displayed to the user every 5 seconds. The startBreathing() function also uses setInterval() to update the timer every second and clear the interval once the time is up.

You can add more elements to the UI and make it more visually appealing using CSS and a responsive layout. Also, you can make this app more interactive by adding sound effects, animations and more.
